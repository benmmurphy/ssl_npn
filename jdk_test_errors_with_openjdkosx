#Errors

Tests are grouped by their final status message.
Program `sh' interrupted! (timed out?)

    ssl/sun/net/www/protocol/https/HttpsURLConnection/PostThruProxy.sh : Need to rebase all the duplicated classes from Merlin
    ssl/sun/net/www/protocol/https/HttpsURLConnection/PostThruProxyWithAuth.sh : Need to rebase all the duplicated classes from Merlin 

Test ignored: After run the test manually, at the end of the debug output, if "MainThread, called close()" found, the test passed. Otherwise, if "Keep-Alive-Timer: called close()", the test failed.

    ssl/sun/net/www/protocol/https/HttpsURLConnection/CloseKeepAliveCached.java : SSL client sessions do not close cleanly 

Test ignored: JSSE supported cipher suites are changed with CR 6916074, need to update this test case in JDK 7 soon

    ssl/javax/net/ssl/NewAPIs/SSLEngine/TestAllSuites.java : Add non-blocking SSL/TLS functionality, usable with any I/O abstraction Iterate through all the suites using both TLS and SSLv3, and turn SSLv2Hello off and on
    ssl/sanity/ciphersuites/CheckCipherSuites.java : Check enabled and supported ciphersuites are correct 

Test ignored: JSSE supported cipher suites are changed with CR 6916074, need to update this test case in JDK 7 soon This is intended to test many of the basic API calls to the SSLEngine interface. This doesn't really exercise much of the SSL code.

    ssl/javax/net/ssl/NewAPIs/SSLEngine/Basics.java : Add non-blocking SSL/TLS functionality, usable with any I/O abstraction 

Test ignored: JSSE supports algorithm constraints with CR 6916074, need to update this test case in JDK 7 soon

    ssl/com/sun/net/ssl/internal/ssl/X509TrustManagerImpl/ClientServer.java : 1.0.3 JsseX509TrustManager erroneously calls isClientTrusted() 

Test ignored: JSSE supports algorithm constraints with CR 6916074, need to update this test case in JDK 7 soon This is a serious hack job!

    ssl/javax/net/ssl/NewAPIs/CheckMyTrustedKeystore.java : Need better way of reflecting the reason when a chain is rejected as untrusted.
